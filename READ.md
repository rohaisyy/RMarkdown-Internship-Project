# RMarkdown Internship Project  
This repository contains my internship project using RMarkdown. I worked with a data obtained from Eddy Flux Tower, which is a research tool used to measure the exchange of gases like carbon dioxide and water vapour between the atmosphere and Earth's surface. The data used for this project was confidential, so specific variable details have been withheld.
The primary goal was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with focus on identifying outliers, handling missing data, visualization and computing the mean. 

## Files  
- `Site_A_overall.Rmd` – The main RMarkdown file.  
- `Site_A_overall.html` – The rendered output.  
- `Outlier_checking_site_A.csv` – The dataset used (if any).  

## How to View the Report  
Open `Site_A_overall.html` in a browser to see the results.
